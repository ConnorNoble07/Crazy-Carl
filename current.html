		<h2>The Present of AI:</h2>
		<p>&nbsp; Despite the boom of AI, only about 17% of Americans knew about it in 2017. This also goes to show how stupid the general American public are. Every part of life is being affected by AI development, despite a lack of general knowledge. Lawmakers and buisness employees are unable to keep up with this rapid development, making it a sort of wild west of the internet.</p>
			<br>
		<p>&nbsp; AI is developing rapidly, art and music are hit hard with this since they are creative areas that require skill and time, something the use of AI eliminates almost entirely. All you have to do is put a prompt in and wait a few moments. This is a damaging thing to career musicians and artits, who make a living with these skills.</p>
			<br>
		<p>&nbsp; AI has writing abilities far beyond many people. It can write paragraphs, mimic styles, write musical lyrics, and much more. The implications for that are, once again: job loss. AI shouldn't be allowed to replace humans in jobs like that.</p>
