		<h2>The History of AI:</h2>
		<p>In the past, AI was much less advanced. But, like all things, as time advanced, it evolved. Here's a timeline of some important events.</p>
			<div id="TL">
				<br>
  				<div id="TL1">
					<h3>Alan Turing and the Turing Test:</h3>
					<p>The first AI concept was by Alan Turing, a computer scientist in the 1930's. His test is widly used to test AI's level of intelligence. A reversing commonly used now is called CAPTCHA.</p>
				</div>
				<br>
				<div id="TL2">
					<h3>60's and 70's Expantion:</h3>
					<p>From 57-74, AI began to expand, due to a decrease in computer price, and an increase in storage, speed, and accesability. Funding was achived by getting the government to pay for it. DARPA was a big funder for AI in this time.</p>
				</div>
					<br>
				<div id="TL3">
					<h3>Moore's Law and the Present:</h3>
					<p>Moore's Law is that processing power doubles every year, and was fairly accurate until our need for that power declined. In the future, this principle will resume, when demand reasonably calls for more processing power. AI have already done increadible feats, such as beating Chess Grandmaster, Gary Kasparov, and Chinese Go champion, Ke Jie.</p>
